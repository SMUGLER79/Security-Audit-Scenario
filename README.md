# Introduction
An internal security audit assessment done on Botium Toys, a fictitious toy company, completed as part of my cybersecurity portfolio and as part of Google's [Cybersecurity Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-cybersecurity) on Coursera in the Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks Course .

The goal is to perform an audit of Botium Toys’ cybersecurity program. The audit needs to align current business practices with industry standards and best practices. The audit is meant to provide mitigation recommendations for vulnerabilities found that are classified as “high risk" and present an overall strategy for improving the security posture of the organization. The audit team needs to document their findings, provide remediation plans and efforts, and communicate with stakeholders.

# Security-Audit-Scenario
Security audit for a sample company; Botium Toys to help them ensure that security checks are made, to monitor for threats, risks, or vulnerabilities that can affect an organization’s business continuity and critical assets. 

Botium Toys is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The business has a single physical location, which serves as their main office, a storefront, and warehouse for their products. However, Botium Toy’s online presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad. As a result, their information technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support their online market worldwide. 

The manager of the IT department has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted. She's worried about maintaining compliance and business operations as the company grows without a clear plan. She believes an internal audit can help better secure the company’s infrastructure and help them identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager is also interested in ensuring that they comply with regulations related to internally processing and accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).   

The IT manager starts by implementing the **National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF)**, establishing an audit scope and goals, listing assets currently managed by the IT department, and completing a risk assessment. The goal of the audit is to provide an overview of the risks and/or fines that the company might experience due to the current state of their security posture.

Your task is to review the IT manager’s scope, goals, and risk assessment report. Then, perform an internal audit by completing a controls and compliance checklist.

# Compliance checklist

I found that Botium Toys will need to adhere to the following standards:

- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
    * GDPR is a European Union (E.U.) general data regulation that protects the processing of E.U. citizens' data and their right to privacy in and out of E.U. territory. Additionally, if a breach occurs and a E.U. citizen's data is compromised, they must be informed within 72 hours of the incident.
    * Botium Toys is expanding to offer services and handle the data of customers abroad, GDPR compliance is in scope for the handling of financial and personal information for customers in the European Union.

- Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)

- PCI DSS is an international security standard meant to ensure that organizations storing, accepting, processing, and transmitting credit card information do so in a secure environment. 
    * Botium Toys must adhere to PCI DSS as it accepts payments online and person and They also store and processes customer credit card on an international scale. It's requirements and compliance need to be taken seriously based on possible consequences. The consequences of not complying with this standard is more severe in impact: Monetary fines, costs of forensic audits upon a data breach, payment brand restrictions, damage to brand reputation, and possibility of lawsuit costs in the event of data breaches. 

- System and Organizations Controls (SOC type 1, SOC type 2)
    * The SOC1 and SOC2 are a series of reports that focus on an organization's user access policies at different organizational levels. They are used to assess an organization's financial compliance and levels of risk. They also cover confidentiality, privacy, integrity, availability, security, and overall data safety. Control failures in these areas can lead to fraud.
    * Botium Toys needs to establish and maintain appropriate user access for internal and external (third-party vendor) personnel to mitigate risk and ensure data safey.
